# Description of the project
The basic idea was to make a tool which will let band practice while one of their members is absent. For example if there is no drummer someone can use drum machine to let others practice.
Simple DJ panel which allows you to mute specific track or the whole song, apply effects to tracks and master. Use drum machine.

# Instructions for use

Click buttons, tweak sliders and have fun.

# How it works

Volume slider are generated using instancing a scene where there is a slider with assigned code to it. See screenshot

For effects sliders I made a button by clicking on which it will change BUS id in sliders script.

For buttons I also generated them using instancing of a scene where I had code attached to a button. Here is the code:

# List of classes/assets in the project and whether made yourself or modified or if its from a source, please give the reference

All code for assets was made by myself. Multitrack for the song was downloaded from the first link in browser. Drums were splitted into 3 tracks which I had to combine using Audacity.
